From Tibet Plateau of China. Tasted flavour of pharmaceutical marketing principles then head down to pharmaceutical research to get enough knowledge of the products (mediconsider systems biology as a promising era of disease treatment. Fascinated with understanding basic biology and cine). Respect to drug development and exploring mechanisms of the disease. Years of research experience in microbial/parasitic diseases using omics technologies (transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomics).
 
Experienced in microbial and parasitic disease research using transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Trained in both wet and dry labs. Skilled in multi-omics library prep and self-taught in R-based data analysis. Known for efficient, high-success experiments. Strong in data interpretation—value deep reading, peer discussion, and insights from field leaders. Adaptive, independent, and able to manage full workflows from sample to insight.
