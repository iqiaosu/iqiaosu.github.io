# 2019–2025 SYSTEMS-BASED APPROACHES TO UNDERSTAND INFECTION, STRESS RESPONSES AND DRUG RESISTANCE IN PARASITIC PROTISTS

_Sub-project of **Australian National Health and Medical Research Foundation Leadership Fellowship program (APP1194330)** under the title “Systems-based study, intervention, diagnosis and control of gastrointestinal parasites” led by Associate Professor **Aaron Jex**._

---

## DESCRIPTION
Basic eukaryote *Giardia duodenalis* possesses a simplified genome that controls its complex parasitic behaviours, such as stage transition and drug resistance, making it challenging to treat and target.  
This project aims to explore how *Giardia* survives internal and external stresses, and to identify possible strategies and targets for drug discovery.

---

## CONTRIBUTION
- Identified albendazole-resistance–related SNPs and key hallmarks of gene expression  
- Suggested different mechanisms of albendazole resistance between different assemblages  
- Generated the first time-point encystation proteomics data for *Giardia* assemblage B

---

## SPECIALIZATION
- Systems biology–based hallmark identification (mRNAs and proteins)  
- Functional discovery of proteins  
- Bioinformatics
