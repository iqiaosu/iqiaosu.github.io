## 2019–2025 SYSTEMS-BASED APPROACHES TO UNDERSTAND INFECTION, STRESS RESPONSES AND DRUG RESISTANCE IN PARASITIC PROTISTS

_Sub-project of **Australian National Health and Medical Research Foundation Leadership Fellowship program (APP1194330)** under the title “Systems-based study, intervention, diagnosis and control of gastrointestinal parasites”, led by Associate Professor **Aaron Jex**._

---

### DESCRIPTION
Basic eukaryote *Giardia duodenalis* possesses a simplified genome that controls its complex parasitic behaviours, such as stage transition and drug resistance, making it challenging to treat and target.  
This project aims to explore how *Giardia* survives internal and external stresses, and to identify possible strategies and targets for drug discovery.

---

### CONTRIBUTION
- Identified albendazole-resistance–related SNPs and key hallmarks of gene expression  
- Suggested different mechanisms of albendazole resistance between different assemblages  
- Generated the first time-point encystation proteomics data for *Giardia* assemblage B  

---

### SPECIALIZATION
- Systems biology–based hallmark identification (mRNAs and proteins)  
- Functional discovery of proteins  
- Bioinformatics

## 2014–2017 SIDEROPHORE BIOSYNTHESIS COORDINATELY MODULATED THE VIRULENCE-ASSOCIATED METABOLOME IN UROPATHOGENIC *ESCHERICHIA COLI*

_Sub-project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (31670031) under the title “Discovery and functional characterization of new siderophores in pathogenic *Escherichia coli*”, led by Associate Professor **Haitao Lyu**._

---

### DESCRIPTION
Siderophore, a secondary metabolite of *E. coli* that chelates iron to maintain its pathogenesis, has been previously shown to link with urinary tract infection (UTI).  
This project aims to explore the metabolome profile under loss-of-function of four different siderophores.

---

### CONTRIBUTION
- Created the first bacteria–human co-culture system for UTI study  
- Generated both *E. coli*–specific and bacteria–human interactive metabolome profiles under siderophore knockout model  
- Found that different siderophores coordinately modulate the pathogenesis  
- Suggested key metabolites that could be potential therapeutic targets  

---

### SPECIALIZATION
- Systems biology–based hallmark identification (metabolites)  
- Application of NMR spectroscopy in metabolomics
