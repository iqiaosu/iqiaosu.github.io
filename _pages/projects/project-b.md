## 2014–2017 SIDEROPHORE BIOSYNTHESIS COORDINATELY MODULATED THE VIRULENCE-ASSOCIATED METABOLOME IN UROPATHOGENIC *ESCHERICHIA COLI*

_Sub-project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (31670031) under the title “Discovery and functional characterization of new siderophores in pathogenic Escherichia coli”, led by Professor **Haitao Lyu**._

---

### DESCRIPTION
Siderophore, a secondary metabolite of *E. coli* that chelates iron to maintain its pathogenesis, has been previously shown to link with urinary tract infection (UTI).  
This project aims to explore the metabolome profile under loss-of-function of four different siderophores.

---

### CONTRIBUTION
- Created the first bacteria–human co-culture system for UTI study  
- Generated both *E. coli*–specific and bacteria–human interactive metabolome profiles under siderophore knockout model  
- Found that different siderophores coordinately modulate the pathogenesis  
- Suggested key metabolites that could be potential therapeutic targets  

---

### SPECIALIZATION
- Systems biology–based hallmark identification (metabolites)  
- Application of NMR spectroscopy in metabolomics
